#Auto-tuning
In Q-learning there are mulitiple hyperparameters that affects the training speed and
accuracy of the final agent, tune them by hand can be a time-consuming job.

Such approch can be done with the idea of auto-tuning.

Relation between hyperparameters can be a function, therefore
we can build such a function instead of test and pick hyper-parameters ourself.
